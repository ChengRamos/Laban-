<h1 style="font-size:35px; text align:center;"> I am so proud of you - and I hope that you are too. Because this, all of this 
- the way in which you hold yourself, the faith and courage that sometimes you think falls short but fits just right, the morals that you carry forward with you 
- is all beautiful to me. I am so proud of how far you have come and if no one has told in a while
 - you are doing just fine. You will be okay and every single thing in your life will work out for the best. But keep doing this - the way you take each day as it comes, the smile that you plant on your face even during difficult times and the fact that you're living, breathing and moving - is beautiful to me. Just know that if the world came crashing down you would find right by your side, urging you on, putting all my faith in your ability to pull yourself up.
 And if you couldn't - if you somehow found that you no longer have the strenght to keep going, then I will give you my strenght instead. I will give you my light and my courage and all of my hopes and dreams if I can - Just to watch you cross the finish line, just to watch you climb every mountain and jemp over hurdle towards hapiness.
 Because you deserve everything. And I am so proud of you - and I hope that you are too. FIGHTING CHENG!!!!</h1>
